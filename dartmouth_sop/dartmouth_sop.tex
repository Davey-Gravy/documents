\opening{Dear Thayer School of Engineering Graduate Admissions,}

My name is Davis Cole and I am currently a R\&D Verification Engineer at Ansys Inc. in Lebanon.
Prior to starting this position, I worked at DEKA Research \& Development in Manchester as a Verification \& Validation
Test Engineer, where I aided in the development of state-of-the-art medical devices. Despite these titles, 
I have been utilized in a wide array of tasks by mechanical, electrical, systems, controls, and software engineering disciplines 
to progress project goals. Having been exposed to this range of disciplines, and being formally educated in mechanical engineering, 
I am confident that I would benefit from a graduate studies at a premier institution to strengthen my knowledge in traditional
mechanical engineering subjects including thermofluids and applied mathematics, and to further develop other skills in software 
engineering such as high performance computing. Considering that the Fluent CFD code that I work with on a daily basis was 
developed in part by Dartmouth and other affiliates, I cannot think of a better place to advance my education.

I was introduced to CFD in my junior year at the University of New Hampshire (UNH) through an introductory course.
After learning about various discretization schemes, solution methods, and turbulence modeling, I was introduced to OpenFOAM, 
creating toy simulations that demonstrated convection, diffusion, and other physical phenomena. Following this course,
I was able to apply my knowledge

Thank you for your time and consideration.

I look forward to your reply.

\closing{Yours Faithfully,}
